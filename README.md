# DigitalLabyrinth
Freshman Fall Engineering Project  
This is is an electric version of the classic board game "Labyrinth".  
I was responsible for all things electronic: soldering, wiring, component acquisition, and programming.  
I also contributed to some of the mechanical development: pulley design, ball socket design, and pulley construction.
